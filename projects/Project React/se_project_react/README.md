# SE Project React - Weather App

This app dynamically updates weather in real-time and gives clothing suggestions based on current weather.

I've used React and APIs to dynamically change and display elements such as weather and temperature. The app fetches arrays for clothing and weather options to display relevant information. Form validation is implemented to allow users to input information about new clothing items, which are then shown on the profile and homepage.
